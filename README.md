# Computer Networking
This repository is based off the book [Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach (7th Edition)](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Kurose-Computer-Networking-A-Top-Down-Approach-7th-Edition/PGM1101673.html).

The `terminology.md` file compiles common terms used in the book as well as other areas of computer networking.

The `ProgrammingAssignments` folder holds a collection of socket programming exercises from the book implemented in Python. The specification for each exercise is given in a `pdf` file.
